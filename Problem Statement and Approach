Problem Statement:

Initial State:
~5 Million dollars worth of inaccuracy in stores are happening due to the end to end processes happening in stores

Final State:
The store processes eleading to this inaccuyracy is identified and quantified. Initial Recommendations are given to alliviate the inaccuracies.

Questions:
1) How to identify the processes leading to the stock inaccuracy?
2) What actions should be taken against these processes?

Approach:

Followed the below 6 stage framework.

Business understanding:

1) There aer many E2E processes which happens in the stores which might be potential factors for inaccuracy of products
2) The stores consist of employee related and customer related actions. The sales in the stores vary on different times of the day and during different days of the week
3) The future vision is to achieve 97% availability in the stores 

Data understanding

1) The dataset consists of 750 instances, from a subset of 3 stores, 10 products across 30 days of time as thhe pilot phase
2) The data includes both numeric as well as binary attributes. HAd about 10 features

Data Preperation:

1) Normaliation: I had to get all the variables into a standard range and give equal weightage to all of them in our driver identification. I have implemented the min-max normalization
2) Blank / Null Value treatment: Replaced all the Blank / Null values with 0, as this was appropriate in the business situation 

Modelling:
Have implemented Linear Regression modelling technique

Evaluation:
Have used the p-value, R square value and adjusted R square values which were obtained during the models building process. As a standard all the p values lesser than 0.05 are considered significant.

Deployment (Next Steps):
Extend the project to more stores and more products. This will give a better picture about the inaccuracy happening in the stores.
